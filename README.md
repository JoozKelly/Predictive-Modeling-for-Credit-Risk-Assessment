# Predictive Modeling for Credit Risk Assessment

## Description

This project implements a multiple linear regression model to predict loan repayment behavior and provides actionable insights for credit risk assessment. By analyzing various financial metrics and borrower characteristics, the model forecasts the likelihood of loan default, enabling lenders to make more informed decisions.

## Features and Functionality

*   **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and prepares raw financial data for model training. This includes handling missing values, outlier detection, and feature scaling.
*   **Feature Engineering:** Creates new features from existing data to improve model accuracy and predictive power. This involves techniques such as creating interaction terms and transforming variables.
*   **Model Training:** Trains a multiple linear regression model using historical loan data. The model is trained to predict loan repayment status (e.g., whether a loan will default or be repaid on time).
*   **Model Evaluation:** Evaluates the model's performance using various metrics such as R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Provides insights into the model's accuracy and reliability.
*   **Risk Assessment:** Generates risk scores for new loan applications based on the model's predictions. These scores can be used to assess the creditworthiness of borrowers and make informed lending decisions.
*   **Visualization:** Creates visualizations to illustrate the model's predictions and key drivers of loan default. This helps stakeholders understand the model's findings and make data-driven decisions.
*   **Reporting:** Generates reports summarizing the model's performance, key insights, and recommendations. These reports can be used to communicate the model's value to stakeholders.

## Technology Stack

*   **Python:** Programming language used for data processing, model development, and analysis.
*   **Pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis library for handling tabular data.
*   **Scikit-learn:** Machine learning library for building and evaluating regression models.
*   **Statsmodels:** Library for statistical modeling and econometrics, including regression analysis.
*   **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** Data visualization libraries for creating charts and graphs.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

*   **Python 3.7+:** Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
*   **pip:** Python package installer. It usually comes with Python installations.
*   **Required Python Packages:**
    *   pandas
    *   scikit-learn
    *   statsmodels
    *   matplotlib
    *   seaborn
    *   numpy

## Installation Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JoozKelly/Predictive-Modeling-for-Credit-Risk-Assessment.git
    cd Predictive-Modeling-for-Credit-Risk-Assessment
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    *Note: A 'requirements.txt' file would need to be in the root directory of the repository, containing the list of all packages to install. For Example:*

    ```
    pandas==1.5.0
    scikit-learn==1.2.0
    statsmodels==0.13.5
    matplotlib==3.6.0
    seaborn==0.12.0
    numpy==1.23.0
    ```

## Usage Guide

1.  **Data Preparation:**
    *   Place your dataset (e.g., CSV file) in the `data/` directory or specify the data path in the script.

2.  **Running the Model:**
    *   Navigate to the project directory.
    *   Run the main script:

        ```bash
        python main.py
        ```
        Replace `main.py` with the name of the main execution script, if different.  The main script will typically perform the data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization steps.

3.  **Configuration:**

    *   Adjust model parameters and data paths within the main script or configuration file (if applicable).  For example, you may need to change the target variable or feature selection criteria.

4.  **Output:**

    *   The model's output, including evaluation metrics, visualizations, and risk scores, will be saved to the `output/` directory or displayed in the console. (adjust based on the actual implementation)
